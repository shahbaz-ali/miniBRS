<H1>Upgrade miniBRS</H1>

**`miniBRS`** does not have any specific upgrading policy. The project is still in initial phase and we have high agility
in the development process. We assume that the users of **`miniBRS`** are familiar with **`git`** version controlling and 
thus, it can be used by the users to update there local repositories. 

We encourage using **`git`** for installation and updation of the project. You can simple make a pull request to the **`master`**
branch as and when required to fetch the updates, bug fixes and upgrade as well.

        ~$ git pull origin master 
        
We shall be releasing the upgrade notes for users, as an when needed to suggest the changes in the architecture and any kind
of data migration or system changes as and when required.
